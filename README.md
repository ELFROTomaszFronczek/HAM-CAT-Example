A C# simple example of controlling an amateur radio.
Requires Omnirig software to work

<img src="Pictures/snapshot1.png" />

The program consists of two modules
<h2> CAMERA </h2>

This is a radio screen preview module.
If the radio has a monitor output, it can be connected via a special grabber module. Then the image from the radio is seen as a camera and can be displayed in a computer window.
The right mouse button opens the menu.

<h2> Omnirig CAT </h2>

An example of a simple radio control program. Requires omnirig to be installed. It allows you to change the frequency, mode, and the ability to transmit.

- Added TRX custom commands controll based on Yaesu manuals.
- Added POTA program window. You can use frequencies directly from POTA spots and activations.

I provide both modules with C# source codes.
